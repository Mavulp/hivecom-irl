# Fix

- [ ] Pull album username from user list, not from _me_
- [ ] Fix album timestamps in album list
- [ ] Ask for album sorting (now is reversed)

# Todo

- [ ] Figure out breadcrumbs again

  - [ ] On detail pages, overwrite breadcrumbs when data loads with dynamic stuff

- [ ] Album creation

  - [ ] Tag locations
  - [ ] Tag users
  - [ ] Set timeframe as a day (checkbox, but sets still from and to with the same date)
  - [ ] Save album as draft (exclude from all lists except user albums)

- [ ] Album editing

  - [ ] Add "edit album" and "delete album" for albums that the user created

- [ ] Album Detail

  - [ ] Some scrolling header with title & metadata? (mayhaps sidebar?)
