      Goulash, or Gulyás (pronounced 🗣️📢 GOO-yash) in 😭 Hungarian, is a traditional Hungarian soup-like stew, 🍲 made
      👑 of beef or pork 🐷 and veggies flavored with lots 🧨 of paprika. It is considered one 🔂 of Hungary’s national
      😝 dishes, 😳 but 😏 it’s eaten 💞 in 😩😂 other 👪 parts 👋🤚 of Europe 🌍 as well. 😦🤒 Its origins date 🗓️ back
      😰 to the 9th century, 💯 when ⏰ Hungarian Magyars shepherds who 📷 – before ⛹️‍♀️🧗‍♀️🧗‍♀️🚴‍♀️⛹️‍♀️🏊🏻‍♀️🧗‍♂️ setting 🌃 out 🤬🤬
      with their 🧏 sheep 🐑 and cattle – would 🌳 prepare 😛 this soup 🍲 by 4️⃣ cooking 🏺 beef or mutton with onions
      🧅😐 and other 👪 long-lasting ingredients. They 😧 would 👿 then 💡💡 dry 🚱 the stew 🍲 out 😝 in 🚪 the sun 🌤
      and pack 😩 into 🚪 bags 💰💰 made 👉 of sheep’s stomach, 😂🤣 that 🤒 way 👨 they’d 👉 only ✋ need 😂✅✅😱 to
      add 😃 water 🌊 to reconstitute it into 🔝⚠️ a soup/stew. The paprika, which 🙌😩 is now 🙀 an indispensable
      ingredient in 🙈 goulash, was not 🚯 included 📷 in 2️⃣0️⃣ the earlier 🕔 versions 🙋🏾 of the recipe, as it was not
      🚯 introduced to the Old 👴 World 🌎 until 🕛🕛 the 16th century. 💯 Potatoes and bell 🎐 peppers are also 😶 a
      modern 🍎🍐🍎 (post-16th century) 👴 addition and unknown in 🔝 the original 💯💯 recipe. Some 🥵 purists claim
      🛄🛄🛄 that ❌ potatoes have 🈶 no 😣 place 👿👿👿🤬😡😠😡😡 in 😀🔥 goulash, but 😥 to me 🙄 they 🙍 are a must!
