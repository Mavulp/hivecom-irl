## Notes

We are currently building this project for our own community and our intention
is to keep the actual site private for now. Feel free to host it yourself and
try it out though. There are currently no build instructions but the GitHub
actions for
[front end](https://github.com/Mavulp/hivefriends/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-frontend.yml)
and
[back end](https://github.com/Mavulp/hivefriends/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy-backend.yml)
should get you started.
